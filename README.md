This is a re-creation of the Doom Fire effect for PSX using Fabien Sanglard's excellent article on how it was done: [HOW DOOM FIRE WAS DONE](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html)

On using bitmaps to render to `UIImage` - these two references were extremely helpful:
* [Making “Giovanni”, a Game Boy Emulator for the Apple Watch](http://gabrieloc.com/2017/03/21/GIOVANNI.html)
* [Swiftenstein](https://github.com/nicklockwood/Swiftenstein)
